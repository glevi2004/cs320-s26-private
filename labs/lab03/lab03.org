This week you'll be given a worksheet with a couple problems to
practice writing derivations.  A secondary objective of this lab is
to emphasize that, when substituting a value into an expression, it is
implicitly /converted/ back into an expression.  So, for example,

#+begin_src txt
  [λx . x / f](f y) = (fun x -> x) y
#+end_src

That is, the variable ~f~ in the expression ~f y~ is replaced with the
function expression ~fun x -> x~ and not the function value ~λ x . x~.

As usual, please use this opportunity to clear up any confusions you
have by asking the TF/TAs questions. They're very smart folks!
